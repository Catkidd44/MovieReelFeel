1. When the prison warden found the Bible where Andy had hidden the rock hammer, it was in the book of Exodus. Exodus is a Greek word meaning ""departure.""
2. Red describes Andy's dream as ""shitty pipe dreams"". During his escape to live that dream, Andy crawls through a pipe filled with raw sewage.
3. If Andy had been incarcerated in just one cell to the left he would have had nowhere to tunnel to except the next cell, and thus would have had no amazing story to tell.
4. The three times Red meets the parole board he is told ""Sit"", ""Sit down"", and lastly ""Please sit down"".
5. Although it is never directly stated in the film, Brooks is in prison for allegedly murdering his wife and daughter after a losing streak at poker.
6. Despite being widely considered as one of the greatest movies of all time, it didn't receive a single Oscar win, though it was nominated for seven, including Best Picture.
7. The last word spoken in the movie is ""hope"", a major theme of the film.",1,2022-05-23T01:51:49Z

I've looked but I cannot find it. I remember the first truly teaser trailer I ever saw I would have been about nine years old. No spoken words...
Probably only 15 seconds long, a complete star field fills the screen and you just hear Darth Vader breathing and then slowly his helmet turns toward the camera... first you see only the shiny parts against the black of space.
Then on screen ""Empire"" coming soon etc. - end -

In February, my birthday came, and my dad and I always went to a movie together. I had never seen a movie twice in a theater. My mom and dad knew I’d seen it in July, and seeing a picture twice was a little unusual then, but I really wanted my dad to see it since he grew up liking Flash Gordon. It was a snowy afternoon, we got over to the theater, and I had just as fun the first time. My dad was very impressed and was surprised how much he liked it. We went to “Louie’s” for a late lunch. It was the last time I saw a movie with my dad, I was growing up and wanted to go with friends and dates rather than my pop. I lost him a few years ago, a few months after that, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. Seeing this clip reminded me I never really had a chance to grieve my dad.

It will make you sad but also it should make you to feel very grateful and happy, even at the movie there are many happy scenes, it is showing us how we should enjoy our life in every situation. Because there is and always be only now. We live in century where we got way too much comfort, and it can cause a lot of trouble when we want to enjoy our life. We are trapped in greedy mindset of getting stimulated by internet or stuff or food or whatever, we are getting too much of everything. Seeing this makes you to rethink your life. There are important stuff, like feel the reality for a moment. Just go outside, breathe, and be happy that you live, you have food, and shelter. It is a lot to have. And i bet you got much more to be thankful for. That is what this movie is doing to me. It is making me think about what is valuable in our lives.

Whereas Kubrick just set out to make a horror film right from the beginning which didn’t work out so well for King. Stephen King’s stories may be scary, sure, but at times they also have humanity that becomes positive things at times. And it also has a lot of moments where there is family dilemma, conflict, and so much human emotion that it makes you feel sorry for the main character as he goes down his tragic story. Whereas in the film with Nicholson it could be swapped out with any other. But King’s version has an interesting three-dimensional character that’s shows step by step what he’s going through and why he’s going through it. And just because the miniseries wasn’t as scary as the film, does not mean that it isn’t good! It actually was very good and very entertaining to watch! And I saw myself watching the miseries multiple times and far more times I did than the Kubrick film where I only watched it only once or twice and that was it.

Mike Flannigan also corrected Kubrick flub that in the book, the care taker who has “The Shining” like Danny, didn’t die and made sure to add him back into “Doctor Sleep”, because he’s in the sequel book as well. 

And spoiler alert, the ending to the tv adaption is correct in how “The Shining” actually ended in the book, not Kubrick’s version.

It's honestly mostly rather bland and forgettable, and while it does stick to the novel a lot more closely than Kubrick's version (as was mandated by King himself), it does show that a more faithful adaptation doesn't always mean a better one. That said, I will commend it on one front that it's received praise for before: the arc of Jack's possession and descent into madness. In this TV miniseries, it comes more slowly and at a more steady pace, and we see how it eats away at him throughout the progression of the story. The original film didn't quite have this, and for anyone watching the film familiar with Nicholson's works now it's kind of expected to see him flip at the end of the second act. Does this redeem the 90s miniseries? Absolutely not. It's still bland tap water viewing otherwise. That said, I will say that Jack's arc alone does make it worth a singular watch, and probably only one.",9,2024-02-12T23:57:08Z

Then you come across certain kinds of films that when you go to the theater and when you see them, you're completely taken by surprise. They make you look at life a different way, and they make you look at being human a different way. They touch areas that you don't want touched sometimes. They’re provocative, which is good. And then there's that rarest of films, where when you see it continually over years (10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years) you still see more in it. And what's even better is that if you're making pictures, you go back to this well, this source for two reasons: 1.) For inspiration and 2.) To learn. To learn how to make pictures.

That’s what it felt like to me when watching Princess Mononoke. Miyazaki is such an incredible storyteller as his films often deal with humanity's relationship with nature and technology, as this film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. It’s not only more beautifully drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script and the soul of a romantic epic between Ashitaka and San, and its lush tones, breathtaking score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema's most grand canvases. It is truly a landmark in the world of animation.",4,2025-04-01T23:34:48Z

Before I saw it, I used to play with nothing but Legos, Smurf and Muppet toys, and one day, my grandfather, who used to buy them all for me, said, ""Well, kid, you're 9- years-old now, I guess you won't be playing with toys much longer.""
   And then suddenly my third grade teacher took all the kids to see ""Return of the Jedi"" for the last day of summer school.
   3 years later, at the age of 12, I was still collecting Star Wars toys now; my bedroom was filled with them in every inch of space, and my grandfather commented at one point 
that he wanted to sue George Lucas.
   40 years later, I still have a bedroom full of Star Wars toys, and ""Return of the Jedi"" is still my favorite of the series (it was my grandfather's, too; to bad he couldn't have lived to see the prequels).",11,2023-08-03T07:06:45Z

Betty Gilpin's character Crystal is a total insane bad-ass 2. There is a lot of non stop violent action scenes 3. Hilary Swank plays a villainess in the movies I've seen her in she plays the heroine. 4. The first time you watch this movie you trying to figure who are the hunters and who are the hunted and last 5. It deals with one small political idea or a small joke can set off a dangerous chain of events.  Overall give this movie a chance and see if you love it or hate the first time I watch this movie I didn't think much of it but I learned to love it and many people will too  I give this movie 👍👍,10,2023-08-06T15:14:53Z

But in the end, it's this person who ll take care of u when u re sick or after u failed an exam. It's this person, whose hug and love ll mean everything to u.

The Catholic church burned people at the stake and abused others, so we -for good cause-don't wish to stoop to overly aggressive measures.  It is a delicate time in this country of such divisions. 

Personally, I continue to ask the Pontiff for letting ""Mary"" out of the closet.  Scriptures are quite obvious as to having other children and we do need a good Mother role model as well as a good FAMILY role model.  

Hence, priests also should be offered the opportunity to marry.  How can one tout family values with no equal status to a Mother figure and have family models within the spirituals of the Bible as well as in the church at present?  

Best to you! (By the way, being from WI, I don't like Cardinal Dolan from Milwaukee as having gotten an advancement from Bishop to Cardinal considering the attempt to move funds from compensating victims in Milwaukee while he was Bishop there.)

You have to look beyond the original to enjoy this one for what it is. Expectations are far higher nowadays and people are always chasing perfection. Thankfully it's not a remake.

It's a Danish crime drama and the Danes are very good at making gritty crime dramas btw.

2. With every transition of Forrest's age, one thing remains the same. In the first scene of each transition, he wears a blue plaid shirt.
3. Forrest's college football uniform is always spotless, due to the fact that no-one is fast enough to catch him.
4. During the ping-pong matches, there was no ball; it was entirely CGI, animated to meet the actors' paddles.
5. Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy, and Martin Lawrence were considered for the role of Bubba.
6. Jodie Foster, Nicole Kidman, and Demi Moore turned down the role of Jenny Curran.
7. Haley Joel Osment was cast in the film after the casting director had noticed him in a Pizza Hut commercial.
8. Forrest and Dan's Shrimp Emporium, ""Bubba Gump,"" is now a themed restaurant in 33 locations around the world.
9. After his experience playing lieutenant Dan, Gary Sinise established a charity to help disabled veterans. To date he's raised over $280 million.

He was only 14 when he was executed by electric chair.

During his trial, until the day of his execution, he always carried a bible in his hands, claiming for innocence.
He was accused of killing two white girls, Betty of 11 years old and Mary of 7, the bodies were found near the house where the teenager resided with his parents.

At that time all the jurors were white. The trial lasted only 2 hours and the sentence was handed down 10 minutes later.
The child's parents were threatened and prevented from giving him gifts in the courtroom and then expelling them from that city.

Before the execution, George spent 81 days without being able to see his parents.
He was trapped in a solitary cell, 80 km from his city. He was heard alone without the presence of his parents or a lawyer.

He was electrocuted with 5,380 volts in the head.

70 years later, his innocence was finally proven by a judge in South Carolina. The beam with which the two girls were killed, weighed more than 19.07 kilograms. Therefore, it was impossible for Stinney to be able to lift it, let alone be able to hit hard enough to kill the two girls. The child was innocent, someone put everything together to blame him just for being black.

Stephen King was inspired by this case to write his book The Green Mile, which was taken to theaters in 1999.",3700,2019-10-29T15:55:18Z

It is very sad story, but very real. It will make you sad but also it should make you to feel very grateful and happy, even at the movie there are many happy scenes, it is showing us how we should enjoy our life in every situation. Because there is and always be only now. We live in century where we got way too much comfort, and it can cause a lot of trouble when we want to enjoy our life. We are trapped in greedy mindset of getting stimulated by internet or stuff or food or whatever, we are getting too much of everything. Seeing this makes you to rethink your life. There are important stuff, like feel the reality for a moment. Just go outside, breathe, and be happy that you live, you have food, and shelter. It is a lot to have. And i bet you got much more to be thankful for. That is what this movie is doing to me. It is making me think about what is valuable in our lives.

Both were good in their own rights -- not to mention the differences were necessary for cultural preferences to meet the different demographic audiences. Personally I like Infernal Affairs better because I felt more connected with the characters. Also, Infernal Affairs is a trilogy (part 2 is a prequel to the first film, and part 3 was jumping between time lines) to help more with the character development -- for me that was easier to retain information better than cramming so much into one film like what The Departed did.",8,2017-09-23T19:38:07Z

I don't know exactly what it is. The fun and excitement. The beautiful unique locations. Ford was born for this role. It's such a special movie. It just can't be recreated. I think when a director truly loves their project and it's their story. Their vision being filmed. It somehow blends into the film and turns a movie into a masterpiece. I Wish Hollywood would allow hungry new talent to direct new films. It's risky but we could be missing out on the next Spielberg or Lucas. Heck, maybe better. In the past few years it's been nothing but sequels and remakes. Hollywood should be humiliated but we keep filling the seats so we really are the ones to blame. CGI is really killing movie magic.

You’ve got mixtures of black comedy, emotion, humanity and power throughout from what is this masterful piece of film work from Chaplin! It’s so clever to see how this legendary filmmaker can portray these two characters who are both on different sides as well as showing how they can be portrayed effectively! The performance for the Hitler esque character of Hynkel really blew me away with the use of the dramatic presences and even in the German speech earlier on as an example in this film and that’s when you know that Chaplin can show the ability to create anything that can work on set with whatever he chooses to do for the films that he can make! It’s so satisfying to see some resemblance brought in from the Tramp into this other character known as The Barber and can still show the classic clumsiness and slapstick comedy just like from the previous films! The fighting scene with the food when both Hynkel and Napoloni react from the mustard is hilariously funny too! The beginning with the sequence from WW1 is exceptionally well framed with the cinematography and I also really enjoyed the comedic acts with the bombs and planes etc! Also we certainly cannot mention this film without the speech at the very end and that has to be the perfect moment to send this film off on a high note! This speech is and will be for a long time, my absolute favourite piece of film monologue ever!! It’s such a moving, thrilling and inspiring scene and to see Chaplin with how he expresses these words shows how passionate he is to deliver such lines with courage and dignity! This incredible monologue in many ways is still relatable and even to this day!! The last few shots from the ending with Hannah looking up was so touching and what a way to end this masterpiece! Tommy! I think you’ll be pleased to hear that this film is now to be one of my absolute favourite comedies and into my Top 3 in that category as well as this to be my 2nd favourite Chaplin film! Not only that but this film is to also go somewhere into my Top 20! 😊🎥🎬",1,2021-11-22T00:21:45Z

Rewatch it tonight in 2023. I felt into cathinones injection addiction 2 years ago.
I decided myself to quit a year ago, but still had relapse. Lost everything : friends, family, job. But I went back on track and found a new job, and kept injecting those craps...
Last week-end, I had an overdose for the first time. This time, I stop for good. Even if it is going to be painful, hard, even if the withdrawal symptoms will be horrible, even if my mood swings in the hardest day.
I needed to rewatch this movie. I am still lucky to be in good health condition, I refuse to end up like any of the characters of this movie.
And I'm grateful that this movie exists, it is the kind of shock that you need to remind you to stay away from those craps.

Best guess is that Han was Jabba's ""trophy"" for about a year and a half before the rescue.
2. Vader discovered Leia as Luke's sister because he could feel it through Luke.
Luke didn't know that until just before then.
3. Luke's light saber is green because he lost his old one along with his hand so they decided to make it green because it worked better in the desert background landscape.
4. Everybody is freaking out because Luke and Leia kissed mostly because she was trying to piss off Han. They didn't know they are related.
5. The ""I love you. I know"" was written into the script to get Leia the shot to say it to Han.
6. This was Warrick Davis'/Lead Ewok first acting gig. He was only 13. 
""Willow"" is his lead with Val Kilmer and worth a first time/share.
7. Awesome camera work with the race through the forest. Nobody in their right mind would go that fast.
8. Carrie Fisher said in her biography that the most satisfying part in her Star Wars experience was choking out Jabba.  
9. Jedi is plural. With Luke and Leia leading the way they can reestablish the Jedi back into the galaxy. 
10.  Ford wanted Han to die in the last episode.
11. IMVHO this is the best of the original 6 George Lucas Star Wars. After the first six he sold it to Disney, and everything changed. Sadly",0,2024-04-15T16:16:20Z

Betty Gilpin's character Crystal is a total insane bad-ass 2. There is a lot of non stop violent action scenes 3. Hilary Swank plays a villainess in the movies I've seen her in she plays the heroine. 4. The first time you watch this movie you trying to figure who are the hunters and who are the hunted and last 5. It deals with one small political idea or a small joke can set off a dangerous chain of events.  Overall give this movie a chance and see if you love it or hate the first time I watch this movie I didn't think much of it but I learned to love it and many people will too  I give this movie 👍👍,10,2023-08-06T15:14:53Z

""There are certain films come with a weight of expectation as there has been so much written and said about them that you watch them expecting a masterpiece; these would include movies like Citizen Kane, Tokyo Story and Metropolis. Regarded as the granddaddy of science fiction films which has influenced everything from Blade Runner to Dark City and The Matrix and even entering the world of music videos such as Radio Gaga by Queen and Madonna's Express Yourself, Metropolis is a giant movie that has flummoxed film historians since its release in January of 1927.""",2,2013-01-19T19:48:08Z

The show is inspired by the eponymous 1996 film written and directed by the Coen brothers, who serve as executive producers on the series alongside Hawley. The series premiered on April 15, 2014, on FX,[1] and follows an anthology format, with each season set in a different era, and with a different story and mostly new characters and cast, although there is minor overlap.

This was made as a balance to the early teaser trailer for Tim Burton's BATMAN. It was a way of saying: ""Hey there are other great movies to see next summer, other than BATMAN.""

With Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, being the best, this can be easily said as the second best, and close to its first. With Legendary Casts, Soundtracks, and storyline made the movie what its worth. Harrison Ford & Sean Connery, was such an iconic duo on this film. Compared to the last, and it's critics, this one was a clear redemption, and one where we got so much more than we deserved. We got to see the many perspectives of Indiana Jones, some old classic characters returning, and a movie that was extra long for us, with an action pact timeline. Honestly sad that they don't make movies like these anymore, and that many of the cast are gone now, and may the legend Sean Connery rest in peace.

I remember reading snippets of this movie from the Lucasfilm newsletter in '88. Went on opening weekend, and honestly was a little underwhelmed - Raiders was my favorite. Did watch another time when it was still at the theaters and gained a little more respect from me. It wasn't till video that I was all in.

1. From what we can see of the mom's ""memories"" (those colored orbs in the background), she seems to have a pretty calm demeanor. I don't see a single red orb back there.
2. This is actually quite perfect because the emotions in the parents' minds are a well-oiled machine. They're generally on the same level with each other and everything's in control.

Hugh and Patrick were the first big characters in our Marvel Cinematic Universe (yes, I'm including Fox into that), and to see them go, 17 years later, in such an emotional and intimate way is a reminder that time ensures nothing lasts forever. It may just be a movie franchise, but for many people, it is part of our childhood, or at the very least, something we turned to for entertainment for years (especially if you were a big comic nerd like me). These movies were my childhood, and I guess it sort of signifies that it's time to move on.

These movies won't be the same without Hugh and Patrick.

Now to start bracing myself for the same to happen with the Marvel property - Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, etc... after these Avengers movies, who knows how long it'll be before they pass the baton?",80,2016-11-04T05:09:27Z

Cannot believe that it has been 15 years since this movie came out and now 15 years later Adam Elliott has another fantastic movie out: Memoir Of A Snail (which similarly to Mary and Max begins in the 1970’s (specifically 1972) and spans decades into the protagonist’s life up until the 90’s/2000’s). 

Saw this movie as a teenager by accident, as I didn’t see it when it first came out because I was too young (I was 10 when this movie came out). 

The best way I would describe it to someone is a platonic “Harold and Maude” meets a platonic “You’ve Got Mail”, if it were directed by Tim Burton, with a touch of Richard Linklater’s “Before” trilogy or “Boyhood”. 

Have to say, rewatching this now, the ending hits harder now that we have lost both Barry Humphries AND Phillip Seymour Hoffmann.",3,2024-12-01T18:27:49Z

காலம் ஒரு துரோகி
படுபாவி, பிசுநாரி

நேரம் ஒரு நோய்
பிரபஞ்சம் சூழும் பொய்

சுதந்திர வெளியிலே, நொடிகள் கூடி போடும் சதியிலே -
நேரம் நதியாய், நுரை தள்ளி, துள்ளி ஓடுமே

ஆனால் -
கைதியாய் சிறையிலே, ""ஓடு ஓடு"" என்று உந்தியும்
சிலை போல், மலை போல், துடிக்கும் மீனை அடக்கும் வலைபோல் அசராத -

காலம்: ஒரு துரோகி
படுபாவி, பிசுநாரி

நேரம் ஒரு நோய்
பிரபஞ்சம் சூழும் பொய்

தனிமையில்
மன திரையிலே
வந்து ஆடிய எண்ணங்கள்

மனதின் கூவல்  
செவியிலே
எட்டி பாடிய தருணங்கள்

என் குரல் மறந்து
தொண்டை மரத்து
வெளியே நோக்கிய கோவம்
உள்-பாய

என்னை மீறி
எந்தன் எண்ணம் 
உணர்வு களத்தை ஆராய

சின்னஞ்சிறு ஆசை எல்லாம்
சிறையிலே சுட்டு புதைத்தேன்
எண்ணிய கம்பி எடுத்து
நானே என்னை தண்டித்தேன்

என்னை போல மிருகம் ஒன்றை
கண்டதில்லை அதுவரை நான்
மிருகத்துக்கு தீனியாக
தனிமையில் நான் மட்டும் தான்

அக-மன அரக்கனை
ஆதரித்து ஆளவிட்டபின்
இதயத்தின் இறைவனை
ஈவிரக்கம்  ஈயவேண்டியே

யுகங்கள் தாண்டும்
நொடிகள் சொடுக்கி, நொறுக்கி,
விடுவிக்கப்பட்டும்
நினைவில் நிழலாய் நிற்கும்
உலகம் நிஜத்தில் அழிக்கப்பட்டும்
 
துண்டித்த பாசக்கயிர் 
நூல்கோடியாய் காற்றில் ஆடும்
திசையில் மன-விசையும் இழுக்க

--

காலம் ஒரு துரோகி
படுபாவி, பிசுநாரி

நேரம் ஒரு நோய்
பிரபஞ்சம் சூழும் பொய்

1. When the prison warden found the Bible where Andy had hidden the rock hammer, it was in the book of Exodus. Exodus is a Greek word meaning ""departure.""
2. Red describes Andy's dream as ""shitty pipe dreams"". During his escape to live that dream, Andy crawls through a pipe filled with raw sewage.
3. If Andy had been incarcerated in just one cell to the left he would have had nowhere to tunnel to except the next cell, and thus would have had no amazing story to tell.
4. The three times Red meets the parole board he is told ""Sit"", ""Sit down"", and lastly ""Please sit down"".
5. Although it is never directly stated in the film, Brooks is in prison for allegedly murdering his wife and daughter after a losing streak at poker.
6. Despite being widely considered as one of the greatest movies of all time, it didn't receive a single Oscar win, though it was nominated for seven, including Best Picture.
7. The last word spoken in the movie is ""hope"", a major theme of the film.",1,2022-05-23T01:51:49Z

I've looked but I cannot find it. I remember the first truly teaser trailer I ever saw I would have been about nine years old. No spoken words...
Probably only 15 seconds long, a complete star field fills the screen and you just hear Darth Vader breathing and then slowly his helmet turns toward the camera... first you see only the shiny parts against the black of space.
Then on screen ""Empire"" coming soon etc. - end -

In February, my birthday came, and my dad and I always went to a movie together. I had never seen a movie twice in a theater. My mom and dad knew I’d seen it in July, and seeing a picture twice was a little unusual then, but I really wanted my dad to see it since he grew up liking Flash Gordon. It was a snowy afternoon, we got over to the theater, and I had just as fun the first time. My dad was very impressed and was surprised how much he liked it. We went to “Louie’s” for a late lunch. It was the last time I saw a movie with my dad, I was growing up and wanted to go with friends and dates rather than my pop. I lost him a few years ago, a few months after that, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. Seeing this clip reminded me I never really had a chance to grieve my dad.

Because there is and always be only now. We live in century where we got way too much comfort, and it can cause a lot of trouble when we want to enjoy our life. We are trapped in greedy mindset of getting stimulated by internet or stuff or food or whatever, we are getting too much of everything. Seeing this makes you to rethink your life. There are important stuff, like feel the reality for a moment. Just go outside, breathe, and be happy that you live, you have food, and shelter. It is a lot to have. And i bet you got much more to be thankful for. That is what this movie is doing to me. It is making me think about what is valuable in our lives.

Whereas Kubrick just set out to make a horror film right from the beginning which didn’t work out so well for King. Stephen King’s stories may be scary, sure, but at times they also have humanity that becomes positive things at times. And it also has a lot of moments where there is family dilemma, conflict, and so much human emotion that it makes you feel sorry for the main character as he goes down his tragic story. Whereas in the film with Nicholson it could be swapped out with any other. But King’s version has an interesting three-dimensional character that’s shows step by step what he’s going through and why he’s going through it. And just because the miniseries wasn’t as scary as the film, does not mean that it isn’t good! It actually was very good and very entertaining to watch! And I saw myself watching the miseries multiple times and far more times I did than the Kubrick film where I only watched it only once or twice and that was it.

Mike Flannigan also corrected Kubrick flub that in the book, the care taker who has “The Shining” like Danny, didn’t die and made sure to add him back into “Doctor Sleep”, because he’s in the sequel book as well. 

And spoiler alert, the ending to the tv adaption is correct in how “The Shining” actually ended in the book, not Kubrick’s version.

It's honestly mostly rather bland and forgettable, and while it does stick to the novel a lot more closely than Kubrick's version (as was mandated by King himself), it does show that a more faithful adaptation doesn't always mean a better one. That said, I will commend it on one front that it's received praise for before: the arc of Jack's possession and descent into madness. In this TV miniseries, it comes more slowly and at a more steady pace, and we see how it eats away at him throughout the progression of the story. The original film didn't quite have this, and for anyone watching the film familiar with Nicholson's works now it's kind of expected to see him flip at the end of the second act. Does this redeem the 90s miniseries? Absolutely not. It's still bland tap water viewing otherwise. That said, I will say that Jack's arc alone does make it worth a singular watch, and probably only one.",9,2024-02-12T23:57:08Z

Then you come across certain kinds of films that when you go to the theater and when you see them, you're completely taken by surprise. They make you look at life a different way, and they make you look at being human a different way. They touch areas that you don't want touched sometimes. They’re provocative, which is good. And then there's that rarest of films, where when you see it continually over years (10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years) you still see more in it. And what's even better is that if you're making pictures, you go back to this well, this source for two reasons: 1.) For inspiration and 2.) To learn. To learn how to make pictures.

That’s what it felt like to me when watching Princess Mononoke. Miyazaki is such an incredible storyteller as his films often deal with humanity's relationship with nature and technology, as this film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. It’s not only more beautifully drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script and the soul of a romantic epic between Ashitaka and San, and its lush tones, breathtaking score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema's most grand canvases. It is truly a landmark in the world of animation.",4,2025-04-01T23:34:48Z

Before I saw it, I used to play with nothing but Legos, Smurf and Muppet toys, and one day, my grandfather, who used to buy them all for me, said, ""Well, kid, you're 9- years-old now, I guess you won't be playing with toys much longer.""
   And then suddenly my third grade teacher took all the kids to see ""Return of the Jedi"" for the last day of summer school.
   3 years later, at the age of 12, I was still collecting Star Wars toys now; my bedroom was filled with them in every inch of space, and my grandfather commented at one point 
that he wanted to sue George Lucas.
   40 years later, I still have a bedroom full of Star Wars toys, and ""Return of the Jedi"" is still my favorite of the series (it was my grandfather's, too; to bad he couldn't have lived to see the prequels).",11,2023-08-03T07:06:45Z

Betty Gilpin's character Crystal is a total insane bad-ass 2. There is a lot of non stop violent action scenes 3. Hilary Swank plays a villainess in the movies I've seen her in she plays the heroine. 4. The first time you watch this movie you trying to figure who are the hunters and who are the hunted and last 5. It deals with one small political idea or a small joke can set off a dangerous chain of events.  Overall give this movie a chance and see if you love it or hate the first time I watch this movie I didn't think much of it but I learned to love it and many people will too  I give this movie 👍👍,10,2023-08-06T15:14:53Z

After all those years of no good animated christmas movies with basic looks and feeling to them, THIS is an absolute gem.
The voices, character designs, choice of animation style and story itself is incredible and very interesting to say the least. So I'm really thrilled to see this and it may just be my new favourite christmas themed story! <3",275,2019-11-05T20:30:58Z
